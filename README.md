# Adding new lessons
1. `src/LESSONS/` create a new folder with the lesson name
2. Inside the newly created lesson folder, create an html file with the same name as the folder.
3. `src/home/index.html` inside the `@@loop` object duplicate a row, fill in the label and the exact name of the lesson folder that you just created. Also increase the count.
4. You can add any css inside the lesson folder and it will be parsed, it is not required to be the same name it will work either way. However, for consistency, it could be called as the html file.
